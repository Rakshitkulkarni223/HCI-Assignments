    <h2 style="color: rgb(243, 8, 8);">Serial Position Effect :</h2>

    <p style="color: rgb(120, 236, 12);"">
      The serial position effect, a term coined by Herman Ebbinghaus, which refers to the finding 
      that recall accuracy of an item from a list varies as a function of its position within the list. The 
      two concepts involved, the primacy effect and the recency effect, explains how items presented 
      at the beginning of a sequence and the end of a sequence are recalled with greater accuracy 
      than items in the middle of a list.
    </p>

    <p style=" color: rgb(8, 176, 243);">
      We can make use of the recency and primacy effect in sequencing items in a menu of a GUI or
      a control panel of a product's interface. The more important or more frequently used items or
      controls should be placed in the beginning or end of the list. Items less frequently used should
      be placed in the middle of the list.

    </p>

    <p style="color: rgb(8, 176, 243);">
      In case of a list using colours, the serial position effect may not be immediately seen. Here
      recall depends on various properties of colour such as brightness, hue and saturation too. Thus
      a brighter colour regardless of its position in the list is more likely to be recalled. This can be
      used to over-rule the serial position effect whenever the context demands. Thus, colour can be
      used as a design element to aid recall.
