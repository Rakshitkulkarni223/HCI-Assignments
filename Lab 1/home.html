    <h2 style="color: rgb(243, 8, 8);">What is Fitts’ Law?</h2>

    <p style="color: rgb(120, 236, 12);"">
      Fitts’ law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target
      area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance
      and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.
    </p>

    <p style=" color: rgb(8, 176, 243);">
      In 1954, psychologist Paul Fitts, examining the human motor system, showed that the time required to move to a
      target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size. By his law, fast movements and small
      targets result in greater error rates, due to the speed-accuracy trade-off. Although multiple variants of Fitts’
      law exist,all encompass this idea.
    </p>

    <p style="color: rgb(8, 176, 243);">
      Fitts’ law is widely applied in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. For example, this law
      influenced the convention of making interactive buttons large (especially on finger-operated mobile
      devices) smaller buttons are more difficult (and time-consuming) to click. Likewise, the distance between a user’s
      task/attention area and the task-related button should be kept as short as possible.
    </p>

    <p style="color: rgb(8, 176, 243);">
      The law is applicable to rapid, pointing movements, not continuous motion (e.g., drawing). Such movements
      typically consist of one large motion component (ballistic movement) followed by fine adjustments to acquire (move
      over) the target. The law is particularly important in visual interface design or any interface involving pointing
      (by finger or mouse, etc.): we use it to assess the appropriate sizes of interactive elements according to the
      context of use and highlight potential design usability problems. By following Fitts’ law, standard interface
      elements such as the right-click pop-up menu or short drop-down menus have had resounding success, minimizing the
      user’s travel distance with a mouse in selecting an option reducing time and increasing productivity. Conversely,
      long drop-downs, title menus, etc., impede users’ actions, raising movement-time demands.

        • MT is the average time to complete the movement.
      </p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        • a and b are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by
        regression analysis. a defines the intersection on the y axis and is often interpreted as a delay. The b
        parameter
        is a slope and describes an acceleration. Both parameters show the linear dependency in Fitts's law.[10]

        • ID is the index of difficulty.
      </p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        • D is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target.
      </p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        • W is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion. W can also be thought
        of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position, since the final point of the motion must fall within
        ±W⁄2 of the target's center.

      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        1. Create a user interface (ideally web-based) that displays an circle on the screen.</p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        2. You must click on the circle immediately after it appears.</p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        3. After you click the first circle, another circle will appear on the screen with a random size, colour, and
        position.</p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        4. Immediately upon seeing this next circle, click on it as well.</p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        5. Continue steps 3 and 4 indefinitely if circles continue to develop (about 30 circles).</p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        6. Construct a table including information about your selection time, target circle distances, and circle
        dimensions (a,b,A,W,MT).
      </p>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">7. Plot a graph with diameter of target along x-axis and corresponding selection time
        on y-axis.
